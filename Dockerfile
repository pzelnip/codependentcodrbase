# Base image to use for builds on the Codependent Codr website
#
# Previously this was all in that site's Dockerfile, but I found
# the installation of npm & the markdownlint gem to be rather
# slow (wasn't uncommon for npm to timeout on Travis builds)
#
# So now we build this base image and use that as the base
# image for CDC builds
